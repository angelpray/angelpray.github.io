# Comprehend 

Something must be changed by youself although the process is hard.
After this days,I know myself slowly that I can do better if I keep calm.
How to always keep calm? how I can focus on myself? how I can't affect by others and cater for othersï¼Ÿ

1. Keep silence.Keep silence means you just express the useful suggestions and share the interesting things.
It is unnecessary to have a cheap talk which is useless.It will make your confusion and can't focus what your are doing.

2. I am a robot.Remember this, when i want to control myself,just think that I AM A ROBOT!
